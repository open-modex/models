# Open_MODEX Template Repository
A common open_MODEX repository. Use this template to create a new repository. 
You can select a template repository while creating a new repository via the github interface.

**General information:**
1. The .gitignore helps you to keep your remote repository clean. You can add file or folder names that should not be covered by git.
2. The setup folders are optional. You can include them if you plan to publish a Python package on pypi, or if you want to include a continuous integration (CI) in your repository to perform automated tests on your code before merging changes. 
3. The test folder is also required by PyPi, but you can save all tests there. 
4. The code-distribution folder can be renamed according to your needs. It should be used to save your code files.
5. The LICENSE is also required to publish your code. GitHub.com suggests some open software [Licences](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository#searching-github-by-license-type).
6. The CONTRIBUTING.md suggest a productive git workflow.
7. The CHANGELOG.md helps you to keep track of new developments and documents all changes and versions.
8. This README.md provides a brief overview of your repository and your project. 
9. Add Badges to the README.md to show the state of your project. An example is shown at the beginning of this README file.
